# MarkItWeTime

A simple personal time management tool that focuses on **time invested** rather than task completion.

## Philosophy

Traditional productivity systems obsess over checking off tasks. This creates paralysis when facing large projects or complex life areas where "done" is hard to define.

MarkItWeTime flips the script: instead of tracking what you finish, track **time spent** on areas that matter.

**Why this works:**
- **Removes paralysis** - No need to define perfect tasks. Just show up and work.
- **Enables parallel progress** - Balance multiple life areas (work, study, health, creative projects) without guilt.
- **Context switching as rest** - Mix pomodoro blocks from different areas. Switching contexts provides mental rest while staying productive.
- **Bite-sized commitment** - 25 minutes is approachable. Big projects become manageable when you're just doing "one more block."

## Features

- **Areas** - Create categories for different parts of your life (work, study, art, fitness, etc.)
- **Pomodoro timer** - 25 min work / 5 min rest cycles
- **Time goals** - Set daily pomodoro targets per area
- **Progress tracking** - See time invested and pomodoros completed
- **Notifications** - Browser alerts when phases complete
- **Persistence** - Data saved locally in your browser

## Usage

1. Create areas for things you want to invest time in
2. Set pomodoro goals (how many 25-min blocks per day?)
3. Select an area and start the timer
4. Work until the bell. Take a break.
5. Switch areas for variety, or keep going.
